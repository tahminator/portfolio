          Over winter break, I got the chance to lead a small team and create a
          project for Patina Network. We decided to make something that would
          help us stay motivated while we grind our technical skills during our
          internship search!
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          Codebloom is a website that "game-ifies" LeetCode by giving you points
          for solving problems on a global leaderboard lets you compete against
          your friends in a lower-stakes leaderboard system.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          We had a lot of fun building this out because of all the challenges we
          faced. A good example was trying to figure out how to reverse LeetCode
          GraphQL queries! Once we did, we then had to figure out how to access
          some of the data that were locked behind protected GraphQL queries
          (things like runtime, code, and more).
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          We're really proud of the project and we hope that people find this
          just useful as we did! Anyone is free to join, so use the links below
          to view the website, as well as the GitHub repo if you would like to
          see the code!

        When I was working at Synergy Prep, I built a webapp that would help us
        bridge the gap between articial intelligence and education. As a result,
        PENCIL was born! PENCIL has all the regular tools that a student may
        want out of an AI assistant, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Chatting with AI</li>
          <li>Upload images</li>
          <li>Favorite messages to come back to later</li>
          <li>
            LaTeX, Markdown, and Code formatters built in to the text messages
          </li>
        </ul>
        and more. But most importantly, students can log in and generate LaTeX
        documents and print them out as a PDF. Students can solve these PDFs and
        use the attached answer key to check their work.

          One of the things that we would do at Synergy Prep was text parents
          about how their child was doing in class. It was a good system, but
          there was a big problem: we would send all of these texts manually.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          So in order to save some time, I just wrote up a simple Python script
          that would scan a CSV file and send the texts with Twilio. Even at
          it's most basic iteration, it helped save the company a lot of labor
          hours.
        </p>

        <p className="text-left">
          The program has seen many iterations from a basic desktop GUI written
          Python and TKInter to a fully-fledged web application written in
          Next.js. The program has been used to send countless messages since
          its inception and has helped the company meet the goal of sending
          consistent messages en masse.

          To preface: Instalock actually exists as a proof-of-concept (for

          Instalock is a tool that lets user log in with their Riot credentials

          However, Odyssey's use shines for people who have some time to call on

          you through more picturesque views throughout your route!
